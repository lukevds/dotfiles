The architecture of this computer is x86_64 and I use it with the operating system and package manager [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix.]]

* Installing user configuration package using GNU Stow

The user configuration package contains user-level (i.e. not system-level) configuration and program files. You can install it using GNU Stow with the following command:

#+begin_src bash :eval never
  stow -t ~ home
#+end_src

You can uninstall it with the following command:

#+begin_src bash :eval never
  stow -t ~ -D home
#+end_src
