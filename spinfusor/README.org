The architecture of this computer is x86_64 and I use it with the operating system and package manager [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix.]] To use the 'home' stow package you need to install the 'common' package first by issuing the following commands:
#+begin_src bash
  cd ../common
  stow -t ../spinfusor/home/ home/
#+end_src
Then you can install the package using:
#+begin_src bash
  stow -t ~ home
#+end_src

The operating system configuration of this computer is available at [[./spinfusor/system.scm][spinfusor/system.scm]]. You can create your own config based on it using:
#+begin_src scheme
  ; my-config.scm
  (use-modules (spinfusor system))

  (operating-system
    (inherit os)
    ...)
#+end_src
And then install it using:
#+begin_src bash
  sudo GUILE_LOAD_PATH=$GUILE_LOAD_PATH:${PWD} guix system reconfigure my-config.scm
#+end_src
